Thank you for coming over to support Lim Kopi Singapore. We hope that you can continue to share this initiative so we can reach out to as many people as we can in this community. TLDR: Lim Kopi is a open activity/conversation community, for seniors or anyone really to learn from each other during this period of time. Please, really hope that you can share and support us. *Please.* **Thank you**.

Just email us at limkopisingapore@gmail.com to talk about your suggestions, ideas, over kopi.
If you would like to be a volunteer, feel free to email as well.
This project is non-profit, and simply to support seniors. No other purpose.
